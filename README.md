# BBiCat
BBiCat (Biological Biclustering Analysis Toolbox) is a software package that can perform different (bi)clustering algorithms on a given dataset.

Name is derived from the original toolbox that was refactored and changed upon the needs of this project. Original implementation can be found at: http://www.tik.ethz.ch/sop/bicat/

Additionally, toolbox contains tools to assess the biological significance of the clusters computed. Hence, the B in front of the BiCat. These biological analysis contains pathway analysis, gene ontology search and Bayesian statistics computation on those.

Right now, Only HGNC Symbols are accepted as input for pathways/gene ontology analysis. This is still in progress as translation mechanism is being implemented at the moment
