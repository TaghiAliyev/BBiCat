 *                                BBiCat is a toolbox that combines different Bi-Clustering and clustering techniques in it, which
 *                                can be applied on a given dataset. This software is the modified version of the original BiCat
 *                                Toolbox implemented at ETH Zurich by Simon Barkow, Eckart Zitzler, Stefan Bleuler, Amela
 *                                Prelic and Don Frick.
